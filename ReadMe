This Python script performs Gaussian elimination, also referred to as row reduction.
The procedure is an essential component of Linear Algebra, and is useful for solving
linear systems of equations, matrix manipulation, and data analysis.

The function rowReducer takes a matrix argument. This matrix is an m x n 2D numpy array, where m
refers to the number of columns and n to the number of rows. m and n can have any integer values.
rowReducer then performs Gaussian row reduction to isolate pivot points. After this process is
completed, the matrix is only partly reduced. Then, rowReducer reduces the pivot points to 1, and
changes the other row values accordingly. After this entire process is complete, rowReducer returns
the input matrix in row echelon form.

Enjoy!
